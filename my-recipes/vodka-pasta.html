<h2>Instructions</h2>
<body> First, heat up a pot of water to get it boiling, since this is the longest process out of the recipe. While the water is heating up, chop up a shallot and 4 cloves of garlic, then cook the shallots in oil in a pan on medium heat until the shallots are clear, then throw in garlic and lt cook for about 30 seconds, to make this dish spicy, add pepper flakes with garlic. Now, add in one can of tomatoe paste and mix with chopped shallots and garlic until all combined, then deglaze the pan with around 1 cup of vodka and let alchohol cook out. Your water hould be boiling by now, salt the water and add in your preferred pasta, I recommend rigatoni, and stir occasionally. After alchohol is cooked out, add 1 cup of heavy cream, you can always add more if needed. Then, add salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and Italian seasoning with parmesan and chopped up basil, and mix. Add one cup of pasta water and pasta and enjoy. </body>
